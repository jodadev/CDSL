# Custom Data Structures Library(CDSL)
### Version 1.0
## Description
This project is a interactive Data Structures Library implemented in C++. It currently supports Array(fixed contiguous) and LinkedList(Singly) data structures, allowing for various operations such as insertion, deletion, and display.
## Installation
Follow these steps on your local machine.
### Prerequisites
- A C++ compiler (GCC, Clang, MSVC, etc.)
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) for building project 
### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
<br><code>git clone https://github.com/jodadev/CDSL.git</code>
2. Navigate to the project directory:
<br><code>cd ./CDSL</code>
3. Build the project:
## Usage
Once the project is built, you can run the executable to interact with the data structures.
### Running the Program(CMake Build)
#### For Windows User
1. Run the build file:
<br><code>./cbuild.bat</code>
2. Navigate to the build folder:
<br><code>cd build</code>
3. Run the executable(.exe) file:
<br><code>./Debug/CDSL.exe</code>
4. Follow the on-screen menu to choose and interact with the data structures.
#### For Linux/Mac User
1. Ensure you have permissions to execute file:
<br><code>chmod +x build.sh</code>
2. Run the build file:
<br><code>./cbuild.sh</code>

## Array Operations
- Initialize an array with a specified size.
- Insert elements at specified indices.
- Delete elements from specified indices.
- Display the current state of the array.
## Linked List Operations
- Insert elements at the front or back of the linked list.
- Delete elements by value.
- Search for elements by value.
- Display the current state of the linked list.
## Features
- Array supporting:
- - Insertion
- - Deletion
- - Display
- Linked List supporting:
- - Insertion at the front and back
- - Deletion by value
- - Search by value
- - Display
